High-Speed Analysis for a New Generation of Advanced Threats Enabling Better Outcomes for Security and Businesses

TitaniumCore performs advanced file analysis at millisecond speeds with a powerful engine for applications of any scale from a few samples to millions of samples daily. The rules engine calculates threat levels based on rules provided by ReversingLabs and YARA rules supplied by the customer, offering scalability in analyzing files and reporting its results. Extracted files can automatically be routed to additional analysis tools, for example, decompilers, debuggers, sandboxes, or other tools that run files in a VM, or an analyst for further evaluation based on threat levels and type to make the most efficient use of security assets. No other product, for example, sandbox or scanner, exposes the complexity of threat indicators extracted by TitaniumCore.
